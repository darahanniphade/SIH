# 🧬 Early-Stage Cancer Prediction (SIH Project)

This repository contains the work-in-progress code and documentation for our **Smart India Hackathon (SIH) project** on **early-stage cancer prediction using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning**.  

Our goal is to build a **robust, scalable, and clinically useful AI system** that can assist doctors and healthcare professionals in **detecting early signs of cancer** from patient data and medical images, improving diagnosis speed and accuracy.

## 🚀 Project Overview  

- **Objective:** Develop a machine learning pipeline capable of predicting early-stage cancer.  
- **Approach:**  
  - Convert medical data (e.g., imaging/audio/biometric) into structured representations (vectors).  
  - Apply **Deep Learning models (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)** for feature extraction and classification.  
  - Use interpretability techniques (Grad-CAM, SHAP) to provide explainable results for medical use.  
- **Tech Stack:** Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, OpenCV, Flask, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn.  
- **Hardware Used:** Training on **NVIDIA RTX 4050 GPU** for deep learning optimization.

- ## 🔬 Current Status  

- ✅ Researching dataset formats & preprocessing pipelines  
- ✅ Initial experiments with CNN-based architectures  
- 🔄 Optimizing feature extraction & model accuracy  
- 🔄 Developing a user-friendly web interface  
- ⏳ Work in progress — final results will be updated soon

## 🌟 Features (Planned)  

- Early detection of cancer using AI models  
- Multi-modal input support (images + clinical data)  
- Explainable AI with **Grad-CAM visualizations**  
- Lightweight deployment for real-world hospital use
